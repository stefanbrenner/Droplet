# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Stefan Brenner](http://www.stefanbrenner.com/).

## [unreleased]
### Changed
- New library for serial communication

## [0.1.3] - 2014-02-16
### Added
- Start execution with physical button
- New button to manually update the list of available communication ports
- The Space key can be used as a shortcut to start a round

## [0.1.2] - 2014-02-11
### Added
- Save the selected serial communication port in the configuration and load
  it at startup
- Now also available for Linux

## [0.1.1] - 2013-02-05
### Fixed
- Fixed major bug with execution of multiple rounds in arduino sketch

## [0.1] - 2013-01-13
### Added
- Processing panel can now be used to automatically add metadata informations
  to pictures in a tethered shooting workflow.
- Filename of an opened or saved file is now displayed in the window title
- Automatically send configuration to microcontroller before start if it changed
  since it was last sent. This ensures that the configuration in Droplet and on
  the controller are equal on every round execution.
- Analog Pins on the Arduino can be addressed with the numbers 50-65 (A0-A15).
### Notes
- Camera Focus can be configured with a second camera device
### Changed
- Rounds and Round Delay not saved to Droplet Configuration anymore
- Changed max.times from 1.000ms to 99.999ms
- Round delay before round execution
### Fixed
- Fixed Bug with Rounds and Round Delay on loading Droplet Configuration
### Known issues
- UI problems with SplitPanes and ScrollPanes
- Problems with RxTx on Mac:
  sudo mkdir /var/lock
  sudo chmod 777 /var/lock

## [0.1b] - 2012-02-23
### Added
- Connect to serial port and show connection status
- Devices: Valve, Flash, Camera
- Setup 0..n Devices
- Actions: Offset Action, Duration Action
- Define 0..n Actions per Device
- Start 1..9999 cycles with defined delay 0..99999999 (ms) (ca.27,7h)
- Cancel cycle execution
- Direct device control: send ON/OFF signal to devices (i.e. for cleaning valves)
- Begin New Droplet Setup
- Open/Save Droplet Setup
- Load as Template
- Simple Logging
- German translation
- Change Serial Communication Provider at runtime
- Change Droplet Message Protocol Provider at runtime
- Droplet Message Format Service
- Receive messages from Arduino and shown in LoggingPanel
- Arduino Sketch that understands and executes the Droplet Message Format (DMF)
### Notes
- Had to use RXTX-2.1.7 due to compatibility problems on OSX
- A maximum of 11 Actions per Device can be used with the arduino
- The maximum amount of devices and actions depends on the amount of memory of the arduino
- Tested on Windows 7 and Mac OSX 10.6.8
### Known Issues
- UI problems with SplitPanes and ScrollPanes
